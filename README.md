# Macro-Keys-Circuit-Python
very simple macro keys using Pi Pico and written in Circuit Python.  Please suggest other things that you may want to have a button short cut 



The credit to the base of this code is Novaspirit and explained it in a very simple way.  In one video he showed how to do an autoclicker and the other he had a one button macro-key on the bread board.

Novaspirit did a great job and helped discover more things to do in the Adafruit librabry that I will hopefully be able to link.....(first Readme file).....I am choosing right now to use the send function over press in most situations and just addidig a Release_All to the end of each button.

Exploring the Consumer Control Code of the Adafruit librabry allowed me to add Play, Pause, Skip, etc and am going to try using some reburpased CD or Tape buttions to add more physical feeling to the buttons.  Make sure to call the Consumer Control library over Keyboard with the audio fuctions
